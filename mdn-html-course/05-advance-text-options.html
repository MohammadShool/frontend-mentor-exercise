    <p>here is a blockquote</p>
    <!-- this is a block quote -->
    <blockquote cite="path to blockquote site">
        <p> you can make your blockquote here </p>
    </blockquote>
    <!-- you can have a inline quote like this -->
    <p>
        hello this is my paragraph
        <q cite="https://google.com"> you can search in me bill gay :-) just for fun please dont execute me :-( </q>
    </p>

    <!-- this is good but how screenreader can know this blockquote from where or our user can know that? -->
    <!-- you have to use cite element like this -->
    <a href="to quote site element"> <cite>this quote is from google</cite> </a>
    <blockquote cite="to quote site element">
        <p>this is a quote text</p>
    </blockquote>

    <!-- we can use abbr element to determine a content is a acronym مخففه -->
    <p><abbr>html</abbr>, hypertext markup language</p>
    <!-- this is a good practive to put a full version of abbreviation front of it but if 
     you want to write acronym to make your text smaller you can use full version as a title attribute -->
    <p>we write this content in <abbr title="hypertext markup language">html</abbr></p>

    <!-- for giving contact infromation to the user you can use address element to wrap you address
      elements with -->
    <!-- note: just use address to give some information who related to the main content -->
    <!-- for example its better to have a address in site footer to show site contact informations
      and have a address in any article to put author contact informations -->
    <address>
        <p>you can find me in telegram @mohammadsh56</p>
    </address>

    <!-- or have a complex contact information including having lists and another things -->

    <pre><code>
function DoSomething {
    const name = "mohammad"
    console.log(name)
}
      </code></pre>

    <!-- why we use a combination of pre and code elements to show a code block? -->
    <!-- beacuse of we know that html ignore whitespaces and just keep one of them
         so we can not have a tab in our code so use pre to solve it and use code to tell
         agent clients this is a block of code please dont think its a normal paragraph  -->
    <p> <var>name</var> is a varible in our code </p>
    <p>we can get a input from keyboard like <kbd>A</kbd></p>
    <p>and this code resualt is <samp>mohammad</samp></p>
    <!-- so we can use var to say the agent or using for styling who this is a variable name
          and kbd mean its a keyboard input and samp mean this is a resualt -->


          <!-- we have diffrent ways to show times in html -->
