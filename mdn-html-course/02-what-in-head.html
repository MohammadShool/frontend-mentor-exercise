    <!-- we can put meta data in our html head like this -->
    <!-- this mean use utf 8 to parsing our text on page -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- this mean dont shrink html document to fill browser viewer and
     keep browser viewport just like device width -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <!-- meta tag help us to determine some metadata to identifying our document
     to diffrent programs like facebook, telegram and more -->
    <!-- most meta tags have a name and content attribute  -->
    <meta name="author" content="mohammad shool" />
    <meta name="description" content="description 1" />

    <!-- beacuse of meta datas just meaning for programs who read our document
     it posibble to have lot of them so you can use some protocol like facebook metadata
     to have a standard metadata elements -->

    <!-- we can determine a title for our document to show in browser tab or 
     in bookmarks or have a meaning for screen readers or search engine crawler -->
    <title>Document</title>

    <!-- we use links to make relation between another files and our document
     so when we use a link who is a void element browser try to get this file from
     local or net and try to make a relation for example in this case we use this
     element to make a stylesheet relation and browser try to get file and parse it as
     a css -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="" />

    <!-- we can use this element to show faicon either -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="faicon-example.ico" />

    <!-- note: link is not just for browser you can make a link for another
     device like a apple to determine a icon for apple when install your document
     like this: -->
     <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="" />

     <!-- note: for linking a script to our html we have to use script element
      and src attribute to script path and defer boolean attribute to say browser
      first make our dom and then run my script to prevent from unexcepted error -->
     <script src="" defer></script>

     <!-- why script is not a void element like a link element? beacuse of we can
      write our script directly in html with script element either like this: -->
     <script>
        console.log("hello world!")
     </script>

     <!-- note: for writing cascading style sheet direct in html you can use attribute
      on html elements or use a element (style) to write css syntax in html like this: -->
      <style>
        .something {
            color: green;
        }
      </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- css as attribute: -->
     <p style="color: red;">hello world!</p>
</body>
