    <!-- how to emphasis on content in a textual element like paragraph? -->
     <p>hello please pay attention to <em>this one</em></p>

    <!-- we can use em element to make attention on something in paragraph -->
    <!-- for more attention we use strong element like this -->

    <p>please pay more attention to <strong>this one</strong></p>

    <!-- you can highlight something with mark element. this is semantic element either -->
    <p>you can <mark>highlight</mark></p>
    <!-- note: we have b, i, u element either but they dont work for us beacuse they arent semantic elements -->

    <p><b>bold something</b> <i>make italic something</i> <u>make a line under something</u></p>

    <!-- for wraping textual content for stylesheet purpose you can use span element -->
     <p>you want apply another <span style="font-family: tahoma;">font on me?</span></p>

     <!-- note you can have a lang attribute on each element and its usefull for screen readers -->
      <p> you can write something in persian like this <i lang="fa">سلام</i> </p>
      <!-- note: you use i element beacuse of you dont want make emphasis but you want to make italic
       and say to screen reader this is a persian -->
